If you need an explanation on how the two PMIs differ and why they are both of value, I've popped it below (scroll down). </p><ul><li>This snapshot from the economic data calendar</li><li>The times in the left-most column are GMT.</li><li>The numbers in the right-most column are the 'prior' (previous month/quarter as the case may be) result. The number in the column next to that, where there is a number, is the consensus median expected.</li></ul><p>---</p><p>The PMIs (Purchasing Managers' Indexes) from China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Caixin/S&P Global differ primarily in survey scope, methodology, and focus. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:</p><p>1. Provider and Affiliation</p><ul><li><p>NBS PMI:</p><ul><li>Compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, a government agency.</li><li>Seen as the official PMI, closely aligned with government policies and priorities.</li></ul></li><li><p>Caixin/S&P Global PMI:</p><ul><li>Compiled by Caixin Media in collaboration with S&P Global.</li><li>A private-sector index, often considered more market-driven.</li></ul></li></ul><p>2. Survey Scope</p><ul><li><p>NBS PMI:</p><ul><li>Focuses on large and state-owned enterprises.</li><li>Covers a broader range of industries, including manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors (e.g., construction and services).</li><li>Reflects conditions in sectors heavily influenced by government policies and infrastructure spending.</li></ul></li><li><p>Caixin PMI:</p><ul><li>Focuses on small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in the private sector.</li><li>Captures the performance of companies that are more exposed to market-driven forces and less influenced by state interventions.</li></ul></li></ul><p>3. Sample Size and Composition</p><ul><li><p>NBS PMI:</p><ul><li>Larger sample size, with about 3,000 enterprises surveyed for the manufacturing PMI.</li><li>Emphasizes state-owned enterprises and larger companies, which tend to dominate traditional industries.</li></ul></li><li><p>Caixin PMI:</p><ul><li>Smaller sample size, surveying around 500 enterprises, with a stronger focus on export-oriented and technology-driven firms.</li><li>Provides insights into the private sector and its responsiveness to global economic conditions.</li></ul></li></ul><p>4. Release Dates</p><ul><li><p>NBS PMI:</p><ul><li>Released monthly, typically on the last day of the month.</li><li>Provides separate PMIs for manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors.</li></ul></li><li><p>Caixin PMI:</p><ul><li>Released a few days later, usually on the first business day of the following month.</li><li>Includes only the manufacturing PMI and services PMI, with no equivalent for non-manufacturing activities like construction.</li></ul></li></ul><p>5. Interpretation and Use</p><ul><li><p>NBS PMI:</p><ul><li>Reflects the overall economic landscape, especially trends in industries influenced by government policy.</li><li>Analysts use it to gauge the impact of fiscal and monetary policies on the broader economy.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Caixin PMI:</p><ul><li>Viewed as a better indicator of the health of the private sector and market-driven segments of the economy.</li><li>Considered more sensitive to external shocks (e.g., global trade conditions).</li></ul></li></ul><p>6. Key Insights and Differences in Results</p><ul><li>The NBS PMI often reflects policy-driven stability, showing less volatility because it covers sectors cushioned by government support.</li><li>The Caixin PMI can be more volatile, as SMEs are more sensitive to real-time changes in market demand, supply chain disruptions, and global economic shifts.</li></ul><p>Why Both Matter:</p><ul><li>NBS PMI offers a macroeconomic view of China's state-influenced economy.</li><li>Caixin PMI provides a microeconomic perspective of the more market-driven and globally competitive sectors.</li></ul><p>***</p>\n                            This article was written by Eamonn Sheridan at investinglive.com.",
